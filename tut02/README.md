Chapter 2 Summary
This chapter discusses the principles of shaping and how it came to be. It shows how shaping is the perfect balance between being too concrete and too vague. When a design is overly specific it becomes very difficult to create an application that matches it exactly, in the same way when a design is overly open and vague, it becomes hard to interpret how the application is supposed to work. Shaped work has properties that help designers and programmers know exactly what needs to be done while allowing them to contribute to the work themselves while having clear boundaries. 

Chapter 3 Summary 
This chapter discusses setting boundaries within shaping. The appetite is a concept within shaping that allows the team to determine the time for an idea to be implemented. It allows us to apply the “fixed time variable scope” principle, where we determine what elements are worth investing our resources to within a specific time constraint. The appetite sets the constraints and boundaries of the idea we have created in the shaping phase, so that we can maximize the quality of the work we do. We also need to narrow the definition of the problem in order to avoid wasting time on useless ideas or features that can be solved with a very simple solution. 

Chapter 4 Summary
This chapter discusses finding the right elements of our software solution. There are many prototyping techniques, however this chapter of the book focuses on two main ones including breadboarding and fat marker sketches. Breadboarding boils down to three main elements: places, affordances and connection lines. Places are locations a user can navigate to, affordances are elements the user can interact with and connection lines take users from one place to the other. The breadboarding prototyping makes us think very concretely how a software solution works by writing out the steps we need to accomplish the project. Fat marker sketches allow us to visualize and see the elements we need. This type of prototyping is not a design or high level wireframe, it’s a very simple, rough visual representation of the work to be done. These prototypes help us decide if we will commit to the project or walk away from it.

Chapter 5 Summary 
This chapter discusses the potential risks that come with shaping. Although risks and issues are things we would like to avoid, it is much better to know and deal with them very early on in the project than discovering something that could stop or ruin the project while working on it. Our goal is to deliver the required work within the scope of time without increasing our appetite in order to complete it. This requires us to look for possible rabbit holes that we can potentially be dragged into by having any gaps or missing pieces to our design, however some rabbit holes can be avoided by presenting to technical experts that can provide input on design work. We also need to make clear, explicit decisions about the project so as to not be confused why certain elements aren’t there and simply focus on what we truly want to achieve.
